            <p>
              My capstone for the <strong>Marketing Intelligence course at Fuqua</strong>. I‚Äôm proud to say it was a deep dive into product strategy, consumer segmentation, and predictive modeling in the gaming industry.
              I tackled a real-world scenario: <em>choosing the most promising game for a developer to acquire in a competitive RPG market</em>. To make the call, I combined both business and technical methods to create a data-driven recommendation.
            </p>
              <p>  <strong>¬∑</strong> Built a <strong>linear regression model in Python</strong> to impute missing price sensitivity data and forecast optimal price points</p>
              <p>  <strong>¬∑</strong> Used <strong>PCA and Factor Analysis</strong> to reduce survey dimensionality and uncover the core motivations behind gamer behavior</p>
              <p>  <strong>¬∑</strong> Clustered player segments using <strong>k-means</strong> and interpreted their affinities using advanced cross-tab and regression analyses</p>
              <p>  <strong>¬∑</strong> Targeted personas based on segment behavior and market potential to craft a <strong>high-ROI strategy</strong></p>

            <p>
              A <strong>Master‚Äôs in Business Analytics</strong> brings with it a variety of courses that, in my opinion, combine the best of both worlds. Classes in statistics, data science, machine learning, the much-coveted artificial intelligence, quantitative market research, and much more, all without losing sight of the practicality these skills bring to a business model. More than anything, it‚Äôs about understanding both worlds in order to turn analysis into a real story that supports decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since arriving at Fuqua, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to take classes with professors whose experience I never could have imagined, and it‚Äôs been a privilege to hear how they use their knowledge to tell us things like, 
              <em>"Your manager won‚Äôt care if your p-value is less than 0.05; your manager will want to know how your analysis brings value to the company,"</em> to paraphrase Professor Belloni.
              These kinds of tangible experiences really make you reflect on how what you're learning goes far beyond a test answer.
            </p>

              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              Even more importantly, it's realizing that analysis that can‚Äôt be communicated is useless, and that you carry business classes with you forever 
              <strong>(I will always be a loyal follower of the Glova school of storytelling)</strong>. 
              This master‚Äôs program has meant being part of the entire data-driven decision-making process: collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and storytelling.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, beyond all the knowledge or the amazing projects I was able to work on at Duke, the most valuable part of the experience was seeing how, in just one year, complete strangers can become part of a community you never want to leave. 
              It's understanding how names you had never heard before become friends you don‚Äôt want to let go of. 
              It's laughing, walking, talking, and soaking in the experiences of others to help grow your own just a little more.

              After being involved in my family business since my teenage years‚Äîand having to learn a bit of everything‚ÄîI was genuinely curious to dive deeper into accounting, finance, marketing, and strategy. It may sound clich√©, but this was one of those moments where I studied something because I was truly interested in it, beyond the social expectations around it, and I made the most of every class I took.

              At Universidad Panamericana, I had incredible professors. I‚Äôll especially never forget my program director, <strong>Lizbeth Nu√±ez</strong>, who gave me the push I needed to be myself‚Äîin the way I work, communicate, and show up as a human being.

            <p>
              The Fuqua Marketing Intelligence team, responsible for advising program leadership, was constrained by the limits of the platform. While survey data from EMBA students was rich, the team lacked the tools to: <br>‚Ä¢ Analyze thousands of open-text responses beyond surface-level themes <br>‚Ä¢ Build dynamic cross-tabs across cohorts without hours of manual work <br>‚Ä¢ Run advanced statistical tests to identify why satisfaction was changing, not just what scores looked like
            </p>
            <p>
              I designed and delivered an analytical layer by:
              <br>‚Ä¢ Building a Python pipeline to clean, code, and model survey data, isolating the drivers of engagement.
              <br>‚Ä¢ Developing an interactive, <strong>self-service dashboard</strong> that allowed leadership to cross-tabulate by cohort, topic, and metric in real time, using Python, Dash and Plotly, without expensive BI licenses.

            <img src="img/llantitec-office.webp" alt="llantitec" class="modal-img">
             <p><strong>Problem</strong><br>
                Llantitec, a regional tire distributor, was facing declining margins and inefficient pricing decisions. 
                With over 3,000 SKUs across multiple brands, leadership lacked visibility into competitive pricing trends 
                and had no systematic way to align costs, inventory, and sales performance with pricing strategy.
              </p>
              <p>
              <strong>Action</strong><br>
              As a Business Analyst Intern, I introduced a structured approach to pricing and operations by:
                <br>‚Ä¢ Conducting market intelligence through competitive web scraping and in-person distributor visits to benchmark SKU-level prices.
                <br>‚Ä¢ Designing a dynamic R-based pricing model that integrated cost, inventory, competitor pricing, and historical sales, automating monthly updates.
                <br>‚Ä¢ Partnering with operations leadership to standardize decision rules around margin thresholds and competitive positioning.
              </p>
              <p>
              <strong>Impact</strong><br>
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>Profitability:</strong> Boosted gross profit by 7% within six months by correcting underpriced SKUs and capitalizing on high-demand categories.
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>Efficiency:</strong> Reduced manual pricing analysis by 10+ hours per week, enabling the team to focus on negotiation and customer service.
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>Scalability:</strong> Created a repeatable framework that became the distributor‚Äôs standard approach to monthly pricing reviews.</p>

              During this experience, I worked with multiple teams to implement programs, migrate SQL databases to the InMoment Cloud, develop surveys and dashboards for analysis, and gain valuable exposure to a range of industries through their CX functions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although my core team was based in Mexico City, I had the privilege of working with colleagues from Canada, the U.S., India, and the UK; an invaluable opportunity to grow my ability to work in multicultural, cross-functional teams.

              I was also fortunate to sharpen my problem-solving skills on live client accounts under pressure, thanks to the guidance of <strong>Fenerose</strong>. She constantly encouraged me to think creatively, innovate solutions, and stay calm in high-stakes situations. Many of the lessons I learned from her will stay with me for life.

              My first work experience was with one of the largest and most recognized companies in the world, Colgate. I will never forget how exciting it was to see the offices of a company whose products I saw every day at the supermarket and personally used.
            </p>
            <p>
              Understanding all the departments and being part of the new products team was an absolute delight. I had the opportunity to see the innovations Colgate was preparing a year before the public could learn about them. I also had the chance to work hand in hand with staff from all the product teams: from Ajax, Colgate 360, and Colgate, to Tom's and Fabuloso.
            </p>
            <p>
              What‚Äôs more, I was responsible for tracking requirements and reporting the launch status to Colgate and the company‚Äôs largest clients. Analyzing so many products and learning all the requirements involved in launching a personal care product was like opening my eyes to a hidden world.

            <p>
             Throughout my life, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to collaborate with various groups in volunteer activities: collecting Tetra Pak containers to build houses, supporting children in foster homes, and gathering supplies for those affected by the 2017 earthquake in Mexico City. However, my two greatest passions have always been related to education.
            </p>
            <p>
              While studying at <strong>Universidad Panamericana</strong>, I had the chance to tutor middle school students in mathematics, algebra, and geometry, students who were struggling with these subjects. I‚Äôve always disagreed with the notion that math is only for those who are <em>‚Äúnaturally talented‚Äù</em> at it, and the students I worked with are proof that this isn't true. Many of them, who were at risk of failing, were able to catch up and even improve their relationship with the subject.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I was a bit younger, I had the opportunity to lead <strong>Cuenta Mundos</strong>, a youth-led organization in Oaxaca dedicated to increasing literacy rates in the state by fostering a love of reading among children through playful, engaging activities. The work I carried out alongside my friends, with the support of Professor Enriqueta P√©rez, earned us the <strong>National Youth Award</strong>, the highest honor granted by the Mexican government to young people for their social contributions.

            <img src="img/qpban.jpg" alt="QuePario" class="modal-img">
            <p>
             For six years, alongside my academic education, I was part of a YouTube channel called QuePario! a project that began as a way for friends to pass the time by making comedy sketches, parodies, and musicals, but which soon grew into a channel with over 3 million subscribers. In this team, I had the chance to collaborate with incredibly talented people, such as <strong>Ron Hern√°ndez (director), Renata Vaca (renowned actress), and Alex Soto (singer and songwriter)</strong>, all of whom inspired me to become a little more creative every day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Being part of QP! meant living a more public life than I had ever imagined‚Äîtraveling across Mexico to attend events, perform shows, and take part in meet-and-greets.
            </p>
            <p>
              I‚Äôll never deny how much I loved being part of that team, and how all the members feel like family to me. But at some point, I had to step away from a project that demanded 120% of me in order to pursue my own dreams.

            <p>
             I've always had a passion for music, and even today, I love spending my free time singing or playing the guitar. That‚Äôs how Caminos Cruzados was born, a project where I could explore my musical and production skills, and over the years, build a community of 50,000 people interested in the project. It also gave me the chance to compose my own songs and upload some of my recordings to Spotify.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although I haven‚Äôt been able to record or share as much content lately as I‚Äôd like, I would never say this project is over. It‚Äôs one of those creative outlets you always return to... with fresh ideas.
